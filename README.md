# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Fundamental Concepts Used in the Project
- Components (Reusable UI elements)
- Props (Passing data between components)
- State Management (Using useState and useReducer)
- React Hooks (useEffect, useContext, etc.)
- React Router (Navigation between pages)

##  Handling and managing data
I have used both Context API and Local Storage for handling and managing data in my project:
- Context API: Used for global state management, such as managing cart data and product details across different components.
- Local Storage: Used to persist cart details so that items remain in the cart even after a page refresh.

## 5 Features of My Website/Project
- Product Listing Page (Displays gadgets with filtering options)
- Product Details Page (Detailed view with "Add to Cart" option)
- Shopping Cart (Stores selected products and allows checkout)
- Statistics Chart (Visual representation of sales or stock data)
- Responsive UI (Optimized for mobile and desktop users)
